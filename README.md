# Object-Detection-tf2
This repository consists of classic object detection algorithms, which are all unofficial implemented in TensorFlow 2.0+. I want to know the model performance of different algorithms and loss functions with same backbone and training dataset.

### ToDo List
- [ ] [FCOS](https://github.com/magikerwin1993/Object-Detection-tf2/tree/master/networks/fcos)
- [ ] CornerNet

# Requirements
Python 3.8+
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
